                        A hard rock/blues rock band, [2] listeners have also classified their music as heavy metal,[3][4][5][6]
                        although they refer to themselves as "a rock and roll band, nothing more, nothing less".[7] AC/DC
                        underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, in 1975. Membership
                        subsequently stabilised until Cliff Williams replaced Mark Evans as bassist in 1977 for the album
                        Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon
                        Scott died on 19 February 1980 after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding,
                        but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist.[8]
                        The band eventually tapped Geordie singer Brian Johnson to replace Scott. Later that year, the band
                        released the new album Back in Black, which they made in Scott's memory. The album launched them
                        to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller.

                        <img class="izq" src="img/descarga1.jpg" alt="logo" aling="left"> Guns N' Roses, often abbreviated as GNR, is an American hard rock band from Los Angeles, California,
                        formed in 1985. The lineup, when first signed to Geffen Records in 1986, consisted of vocalist Axl
                        Rose, lead guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Steven
                        Adler. Guns N' Roses has released six studio albums, accumulating sales of more than 100 million
                        records worldwide, including 45 million in the United States, making them the 41st best-selling artist
                        of all time. Guns N' Roses' debut album, Appetite for Destruction (1987), reached number one on the
                        Billboard 200 a year after its release, on the strength of "Sweet Child o' Mine", the band's only
                        single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The album has sold approximately 30 million
                        copies worldwide, including 18 million units in the United States, making it the best-selling debut
                        album of all time in the US, as well as the eleventh best-selling album in the United States. The
                        success of the debut was followed by the eight-song album G N' R Lies (1988) which reached number
                        two on the Billboard 200. The twin albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II (1991) debuted
                        at number two and number one on the Billboard 200 respectively and have sold a combined 35 million
                        copies worldwide, including 14 million units in the United States. The cover album "The Spaghetti
                        Incident?" (1993) was the band's last studio album to feature Slash and McKagan.
